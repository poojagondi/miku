# Stickers Folder

This folder contains all the sticker images that can be used in the Miku Note editor.

## How to Add New Stickers

1. **Add PNG files** to this folder (`/public/stickers/`)
2. **File naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `happy-face.png`, `thumbs-up.png`)
3. **Supported format**: Only PNG files are supported
4. **File size**: Keep files reasonably small for better performance (recommended < 500KB)
5. **Image dimensions**: Square images work best (e.g., 512x512px)

## Auto-Detection

The sticker picker will automatically:

- âœ… Detect all PNG files in this folder
- âœ… Generate proper names from filenames (e.g., `happy-face.png` â†’ "Happy Face")
- âœ… Create sticker options without code changes
- âœ… Refresh when the picker is opened

## Current Stickers

- `think.png` - Thinking character
- `mikuuu.png` - Miku character

Just drop new PNG files here and they'll appear in the sticker picker! ðŸŽ‰
